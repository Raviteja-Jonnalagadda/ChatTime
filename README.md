## Introduction

ChatTime is an innovative chat application currently in its initial development stage. It allows users to create accounts and engage in real-time conversations with other ChatTime users.

## Current Status

At this stage, I have developed a foundational platform and a user interface to facilitate basic chatting functionalities. The project is still in the building phase, and I am actively working on enhancing its features.

## Future Plans

The current focus is on implementing core messaging capabilities, specifically enabling the transfer of text messages between users. Media file transfer and other advanced features are planned for future updates. I will keep the community updated as new features are integrated.
